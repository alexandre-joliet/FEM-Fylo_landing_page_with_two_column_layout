## My process

This project was quite a challenge. Not very difficult per see, but it was my first "real" landing page project. Fist time I worked with a mobile-first approach as well!

I missed in the beginning some clues in the designs regarding the structure of the HTML and I had to review and modify it a couple of times later to make sure it was behaving the right way on different screens.

1. Analyse of the design schema to identify the different items and how to built the right elements in the HTML file
2. Building of the HTML structure and semantic. I did quite well but nonetheless needed to correct or fix little things later on the project to match the different screens
3. Starting of building the style in CSS, from top to bottom
4. Polishing the mobile version
5. Building of the desktop version
6. Adding additional breakpoint between large and small screens


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM methodology
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Always compared the different designs and to have the best HTML structure possible from the beginning
- Improved my knowledge on responsiveness
